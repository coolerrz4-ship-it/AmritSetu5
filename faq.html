  <!-- FAQ Content -->
  <section class="faq-section">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is AmritSetu?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        AmritSetu is a digital health platform designed to unify India’s fragmented healthcare ecosystem. It connects hospitals, clinics, diagnostic labs, and patients under one secure digital network — enabling health data to move safely and seamlessly between trusted parties.  
        <br><br>
        Instead of isolated health apps, AmritSetu acts as a bridge — storing your medical records in a lifelong digital vault, helping you access reports anytime, anywhere, and allowing healthcare providers to make better, faster, and more informed decisions.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">How do we plan to partner with the Government?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        AmritSetu is built in alignment with India’s <strong>Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)</strong> and integrates with the <strong>ABHA Health ID</strong> framework by the National Health Authority (NHA).  
        <br><br>
        By becoming a certified <strong>Health Information Provider (HIP)</strong> and <strong>Health Information User (HIU)</strong>, AmritSetu can exchange verified health data through the government’s secure API network. This ensures all medical information shared through our system follows India’s national digital health standards — encrypted, traceable, and consent-based.  
        <br><br>
        For the government, this accelerates digital adoption across smaller private clinics and hospitals, bridging them into the national health grid — exactly what AmritSetu aims to do.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Why would hospitals and clinics join us?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Managing paper reports and manual data entry consumes time and creates errors. With AmritSetu, healthcare providers receive a ready-made digital interface that automatically syncs verified patient data while staying compliant with the ABDM and DPDPA.  
        <br><br>
        Clinics benefit from:<br>
        • Instant access to verified medical history<br>
        • Reduced redundant tests and improved coordination<br>
        • Higher patient trust through transparent data handling<br><br>
        This not only saves time but enhances care quality and efficiency.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Should you trust AmritSetu with your data?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Absolutely. Privacy and consent are at the core of AmritSetu’s philosophy. We use <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong>, <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong>, and <strong>zero-knowledge architecture</strong> — meaning even we cannot view your private data.  
        <br><br>
        In the rare event of a cyber threat, our systems isolate affected servers, notify users immediately, and report incidents in compliance with India’s <strong>Data Protection Act</strong>. Every action taken on your data is logged, traceable, and entirely under your control.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Is the AI in AmritSetu safe and ethical?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Our AI models operate on anonymized, locally processed data — ensuring that no personally identifiable information leaves your secure environment.  
        <br><br>
        The AI simply analyzes trends such as thyroid, sugar, or cholesterol patterns to provide insights and preventive health suggestions. It follows strict medical data ethics and uses government-approved algorithms.  
        <br><br>
        In short, our AI helps you stay informed — never monitored.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">Can AmritSetu solve the retesting problem?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Yes — that’s one of our core missions. Many hospitals repeat tests because they cannot verify external reports. AmritSetu eliminates this problem by providing <strong>digitally verified reports</strong> stamped with <strong>official digital signatures</strong> under the ABDM framework.  
        <br><br>
        This makes your medical results universally valid across the AmritSetu network, government hospitals, and private clinics — saving time, money, and avoiding unnecessary retesting.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
  <div class="faq-question">How can this become reality?</div>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    To make AmritSetu a reality, our first step is to integrate directly with the 
    <strong>Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)</strong> through its official sandbox program 
    managed by the <strong>National Health Authority (NHA)</strong>. 
    This allows us to test our platform’s security, data flow, and consent systems under government supervision. 
    <br><br>
    Once verified, AmritSetu will register as a certified 
    <strong>Health Information Provider (HIP)</strong> and 
    <strong>Health Information User (HIU)</strong> — enabling secure data exchange with hospitals, labs, 
    and clinics already linked to the ABDM network. 
    <br><br>
    We will then onboard small and mid-level healthcare centers by offering easy digital integration tools, 
    helping them connect their records to the national framework. Partnering with local health authorities, 
    state e-governance missions, and private labs will further expand coverage. 
    <br><br>
    By following ABDM’s data privacy, encryption, and interoperability standards, 
    AmritSetu will operate as a trusted digital bridge between India’s healthcare system and its citizens — 
    fully aligned with national digital health goals.
  </div>
</div>


    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-question">What is the bigger vision of AmritSetu?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Our long-term goal is to become India’s most trusted digital health bridge — connecting people, hospitals, and data into one transparent system.  
        <br><br>
        AmritSetu aims to redefine how healthcare data is managed and shared: secure, consent-driven, and accessible to every Indian citizen. We envision a future where digital health is not just efficient, but equitable — bringing reliable care closer to every household in the country.
